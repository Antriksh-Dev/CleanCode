 Load Feed From Remote Use Case
 
 Data: URL
 
 Primary course (happy path):
 1. Execute 'Load Feed' command with the above data.
 2. System downloads data from the URL.
 3. System validates the downloaded data.
 4. System creates 'Feed' models using the validated data.
 5. System delivers Feed of the user.
 
 Invalid data - error course (sad path):
 1. System delivers invalid data error.
 
 No connectivity - error course (sad path):
 1. System delivers connectivity error.
